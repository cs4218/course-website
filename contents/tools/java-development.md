## [BETA] Java Development

We are undergoing beta for Java development in this module.
The following are some of the limitations:

* Limited number of teams will be allowed to develop the project in Java instead of C++.
* Developing the project in Java is experimental in nature.
* It is tested only in macOS, and while it is available on Windows, it is highly not recommended.
* There will be close to no support for any issues from the teaching team.
* If anything goes wrong in your development, you are still expected to produce work in C++.
* Indication of interest to use Java does not guarantee the choice of Java for the project.

We will collect your team's interest in Week 2, and will finalize details with your team.

A wrapper with some details to kick start will be given.
