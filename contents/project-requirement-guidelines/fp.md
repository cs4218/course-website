[](final-presentation-guidelines)Final Presentation Guidelines
==============================================================

For Milestone 3, each team will be allocated to a private 45-minute time slot for a final presentation.

Not all team members need to present their work, but all team members must be physically around for the presentation.

All sessions will be conducted physically.

The flow of the presentation is as follows:

* Presentation: 20 minutes
* Q & A: 15 minutes
* Any other issues (e.g. failed test cases): 10 minutes

=============================================

In your presentation, you should make use of your report and cover the following:

1. What are the software engineering principles and practices you and your teammates followed?

2. How did you plan your development process?

3. What is the architecture of your system?

4. What are the notable features you have implemented, and what are the approaches you have implemented that is unique and/or beneficial to your team?

5. What is your test plan, and how did you test your system to ensure correctness and efficiency?

Make use of the presentation to convince us that your hard work applying what you have learnt in the past deserves a good grade.

Do not:

1. Present things we already know from the wiki.

2. Explain the design of every single component unless there is something special.
