=======================

Before starting work on Milestone 2, consult your tutor about your [proposed scope](scope.html) preferably by **Week 8**.

Fill in survey available on Canvas by **17 Oct (Week 10 Mon), 2pm** finalizing on the scope of your project. You should be able to demonstrate each feature end-to-end during the code demonstration.

Code Submission Deadline: **17 Oct (Week 10 Mon), 2pm**

*   Penalty for late submission within 24 hours: **20% of the maximum score (i.e. 2% of your module grade)**

*   Tagged commit will also be used to run test cases used in Milestone 1 if your prototype had major issues. TAs will be in contact with you separately.

Report Submission Deadline: **19 Oct (Week 10 Wed), 2pm**

*   Penalty for late submission within 24 hours: **20% of the maximum score (i.e. 1% of your module grade)**
*   Submission after **20 Oct (Week 10 The), 2pm** will not be accepted, and no marks will be awarded.

Oral Presentation: **Week 9 to Week 10**, to be scheduled with your module coordinators.

Do refer to:

*   [Report Submission Guidelines](../project-requirement-guidelines/rsg.html)
*   [Code Submission Guidelines](../project-requirement-guidelines/csg.html)
*   [Code Demonstration Guidelines](../project-requirement-guidelines/cdg.html)
*   [Oral Presentation Guidelines](../project-requirement-guidelines/opg.html#oral-presentation-guidelines)

[](#marking-scheme)Marking Scheme
=================================

Milestone 2 accounts for **15%** of the final grade.

*   **5%**: [Correctness](../project-requirement-guidelines/gg.html#spa-correctness-grading) based on AutoTester evaluation
*   **5%**: [Report](../project-requirement-guidelines/gg.html#report-grading) + [Oral Presentation](../project-requirement-guidelines/opg.html#oral-presentation-guidelines)
*   **5%**: [Code Review](../project-requirement-guidelines/gg.html#code-review)

Having a code demonstration with insufficient quality will result in a penalty in Milestone 2. A quality code demonstration should demonstrate that the proposed scope is thoroughly implemented and well tested.

Individual penalty / bonus is possible if someone in the team is making very little / a lot of contributions.

*   Please let the teaching team know about such cases through the peer review which will be open right after the deadline.
*   We will arrange a meeting with your team to discuss about such matters.

**Weightage is subjected to change without prior notice.**
