# Tools

A software team needs a set of good tools to build a product.
For CS3203, we recommend the following tools:

* C++ Compiler: Visual Studio 2022/2019. Please avoid using older versions of Visual Studio because you may have problems integrating with AutoTester. You can also use other C++ compilers such as CLion (for macOS).

* Version Control System (VCS): You are required to use Git with the GitHub repository provided.

* Unit Testing Framework: You can use VS Unit Testing, cppUnit, or any other frameworks.

* Project Management Tools: You are required to use features in GitHub Issues / JIRA Cloud to do project management.

* Documentation: You can use Doxygen or other documentation tools.

* Design Tools: You can use AgroUML, Visio and other tools for creating and maintaining the UML models of your project.

# Tools Lab

There will be an optional tools lab in Week 2 to help you resolve any technical issues related to the tools.

Attend only if you require assistance after trying to install the tools through following instructions in GitHub Wiki.

* [F2F @ SR1] 20 Jan (Week 2 Fri), 10am-1pm

***Some level of troubleshooting should have been done together with Tzerbin before the session, either through email or Zoom sessions by appointment.***

***Assistance will be prioritized for students who has attempted following instructions through the Wiki.***

***Due to time constraints, you should discuss with your teammates on the choice of startup solution first, before attempting setting up.***
