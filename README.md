## Setting up

1. Clone this repo.
1. [Install npm, Node.js and MarkBind](https://markbind.org/userGuide/gettingStarted.html)

## Updating content

1. Update content using MarkBind syntax ([How to use MarkBind](https://markbind.org/userGuide/authoringContents.html))
1. `markbind serve` to start the local server (to preview changes). This command also initiates the live-preview ability i.e. when any changes to the MarkBind code is saved, the site is auto-generated and the Web page (that was opened by the `serve` command) auto-refreshes to show the new content. This works well for small websites but not so well for this website. Recommended to shutdown the server (`Ctrl+C`) before doing further edits.
1. When you are happy with the edits, use the `markbind deploy` to deploy to the GitHub website at the `origin` repo.
   1. If the deployment failed due to a 'caching' issue, try deleting the the cache generated by the previous deploy command (on Windows, the cache can be found in `/c/Users/{user-name}/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/markbind-cli/node_modules/gh-pages/.cache`)
