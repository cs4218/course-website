# Team Formation

Each project team consists of ideally 5-6 students and will be formed in Week 2. Students will be able to choose some of the teammates, but the rest of the teammates will be randomly allocated.

The process is divided into 2 steps:

Step 1: Choose some team members

* Form a group of 2-3 people.

* Register your group on Canvas under People -> Project Team Formation by 15 Aug (Week 2 Mon) 2pm.

If you are unable to access, please contact Tzer Bin (dcsnt@nus.edu.sg) via MSTeams as soon as possible.

Please note that you have been allocated a lecture slot (L1, L2, L3 or L4). L1 and L2 happens from 12-2pm and L3 and L4 happens from 2-4pm on Tuesdays.

If your team members are from within the same time slot, we can rearrange you to attend the same lecture session.

* For example, if your team members are within L1 and L2 (or within L3 and L4), we can swap easily since that happens at the same time.
* However, if your team contains people from cross timings (for example, L1 and L3) then we can arrange a single lecture slot for you provided you have no clash in timetable on both timings.

Step 2: Randomly get some team members

* Groups (and anyone without a group) will be randomly combined.

* Teams will be announced by 15 Aug (Week 2 Mon) 6pm.

Let us know if you have any issue in working with students in your team by the end of 16 Aug (Week 2 Tue) 6pm.
