## Tools Downloads

This page provides the links to the project-related files.

For the downloading and installing of software and packages (e.g. Visual Studio 2019), please refer to the guide specific to each startup solution in the Wiki.

The file packages for each start up solution are mainly for you to try out and decide which one your team will use. They will be available in the GitHub repository provided as described in <a href = "https://github.com/nus-cs3203/project-wiki/wiki/Version-Control-System-and-Code-Repository" target="_blank">Version Control System and Repository.</a>

This SIMPLE source program is included in the startup solution, which allows you to test your source parser in Iteration 1.

Note that you will need to remove "\x" in the source program as it is only used for your understanding.

## Python Script check-submission.py

This Python script is included in both of the startup solutions, which allows you to check the format of your submission. You can simply run `python check-submission.py` to check that your folder is compliant with our submission requirements.
