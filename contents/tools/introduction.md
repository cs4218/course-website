# Tools

A software team needs a set of good tools to build a product.
For CS3203, we recommend the following tools:

* C++ Compiler: Visual Studio 2022/2019. Please avoid using older versions of Visual Studio because you may have problems integrating with AutoTester. You can also use other C++ compilers such as CLion (for macOS).

* Version Control System (VCS): You are required to use Git with the GitHub repository provided.

* Unit Testing Framework: You can use VS Unit Testing, cppUnit, or any other frameworks.

* Project Management Tools: You are required to use features in GitHub Issues / JIRA Cloud to do project management.

* Documentation: You can use Doxygen or other documentation tools.

* Design Tools: You can use AgroUML, Visio and other tools for creating and maintaining the UML models of your project.

# Tools Lab

There will be an optional tools lab in Week 2 to help you resolve any technical issues related to the tools.

Sign up and attend only if you require assistance after trying to install the tools through following instructions in GitHub Wiki.

You can choose to join via Zoom meetings, or physical labs.
