*   Penalty for late submission within 24 hours: **20% of the maximum score (i.e. 1% of your module grade)**

*   Tagged commit will also be used to run test cases used in Milestone 1 if your prototype had major issues. TAs will be in contact with you separately.

Report Submission Deadline: **TBD, 2pm**

*   Penalty for late submission within 24 hours: **20% of the maximum score (i.e. 0.6% of your module grade)**

[](#marking-scheme)Marking Scheme
=================================

Milestone 2 accounts for **18%** of the final grade.

*   **5%**: [Correctness](../project-requirement-guidelines/gg.html#spa-correctness-grading) based on AutoTester evaluation on Basic SPA requirements
*   **3%**: [Continuous Integration](../tools/continuous-integration.html)
*   **7%**: [Individual Oral Presentation](../project-requirement-guidelines/opg.html#oral-presentation-guidelines)
*   **3%**: [Report](../project-requirement-guidelines/gg.html#report-grading)
*   **Penalty**: [Code Review](../project-requirement-guidelines/gg.html#code-review)

Having a code demonstration with insufficient quality will result in a penalty in Milestone 2. A quality code demonstration should demonstrate that the proposed scope is thoroughly implemented and well tested.

Individual penalty / bonus is possible if someone in the team is making very little / a lot of contributions.

*   Please let the teaching team know about such cases through the peer review which will be open right after the deadline.
*   We will arrange a meeting with your team to discuss about such matters.

**Weightage is subjected to change without prior notice.**
