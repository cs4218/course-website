[](#code-demonstration-guidelines)Code Demonstration Guidelines
===============================================================

In **Week 5, Week 8, and Week 10 (for Milestone 2)**, you are expected to give a demonstration of your system.

For the demonstration, you are to prepare:

1.  A compiled-and-built SPA via the Autotester executable.
    
2.  System test cases to show that the features implemented in SPA is well-tested. It should include multiple pairs of:
    
    *   SIMPLE source
    *   set of PQL queries for the SIMPLE source code
3.  Generated `.xml` files from feeding the test cases to the executable.
    

During the demonstration, your tutor will request for you to:

1.  Re-run the executable using the system test cases that you have prepared and generate `.xml` files.
2.  Open the `.xml` files for analysis.

Your tutor will comment on your test cases and may change your test cases on the fly.

Code demonstrations are not meant as a harsh evaluation, but rather a gentle push to ensure you have meet the expected milestones.
