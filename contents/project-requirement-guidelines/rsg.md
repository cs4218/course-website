[](#report-submission-guidelines)Report Submission Guidelines
=============================================================

Create a `.pdf` file named `TeamXX.pdf`, where `XX` is your team number.

In your report, ensure that you include your team number, and information (full name, matriculation no.) of your team members.

Submit the file via `Canvas > CS3203 > Assignments > Milestone X (Report)`.

Each team should submit only **one** copy of the report. For multiple submissions received from the same team, we will mark the most recent one.

[](#report-format)Report Format
===============================

The Project Report Template should be used for your submission, and is available on Canvas.

**Additional Suggestion**

*   Include a navigable _table of content_ after the cover page.

[](#tips)Tips
=============

It is very important to make your report clear, concise, complete, standalone and readable.

*   Use good examples to illustrate your design.

You can repeat information found in reports you submitted in previous milestones, if applicable.

*   Integrate new parts organically into the report, and condense any existing parts.
*   Be brief about things that we already know well.
*   Update your set of PKB abstract APIs for all the implemented features up to the current milestone.

Avoid repeating material contained in the GitHub Wiki. If necessary, simply make a reference.
