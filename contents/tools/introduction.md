# Tools

A software team needs a set of good tools to build a product.
For CS3203, we recommend the following tools:

* Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio 2022/2019 (recommended for Windows) or CLion (recommended for macOS). Please avoid using older versions of Visual Studio because you may have problems integrating with AutoTester. You can also use other IDEs that are not recommended as long as you know how to set up the correct compilers for the startup solution.

* C++ Compilers: MSVC (automatically available with Visual Studio 2022/2019) for team members developing on Windows, or AppleClang (automatically available with Xcode) for team members developing on macOS.

* Version Control System (VCS): You are required to use Git with the GitHub repository provided.

* Unit Testing Framework: You can use VS Unit Testing, cppUnit, or any other frameworks.

* Project Management Tools: You are required to use features in GitHub Issues / JIRA Cloud / TROFOS to do project management.

* Documentation: You can use Doxygen or other documentation tools.

* Design Tools: You can use AgroUML, Visio and other tools for creating and maintaining the UML models of your project.

# Tools Lab

There will be an optional tools lab in Week 2 to help you resolve any technical issues related to the tools.

Attend only if you require assistance after trying to install the tools through following instructions in GitHub Wiki.

* Date, Time, Venue will be announced through Canvas.

***Some level of troubleshooting should have been done together with Tzerbin before the session, either through email or Zoom sessions by appointment.***

***Assistance will be prioritized for students who has attempted following instructions through the Wiki.***

***Due to time constraints, you should discuss with your teammates on the choice of startup solution first, before attempting setting up.***
